# Federal Funds Rate

## What is the Fed Funds rate?
One of the primary tools in monetary policy is the ability of a central bank to set interest rates. The U.S. Federal Reserve does this by changing the Federal Funds rate, which is the rate charged on loans made from the Fed to private banks on their reserve balances.

The Fed controls all other interest rates in the economy, or the "interest rate regime", via the Federal Funds rate. Rates on other types of lending such as government (public-proivate), wholesale (private bank to private bank), or retail (private bank to customer) debt are determined in part by this underlying rate.

Fed Funds is also called the "risk-free" rate as it represents the closest thing to a riskless borrowing rate in U.S. currency. It represents an important benchmark in nominal terms for other interest rates. Typically the nominal rate of return in lending would be a baseline risk-free rate plus a credit spread based on creditworthiness, with a higher rate charged to riskier borrowers.

The credit spread remains the same, but the risk-free changes.

The Fed Funds is an important benchmark that sets the nominal risk-free rate or minimum interest rate in the economy. All other interest rates generally follow a spread above Fed Funds. If Fed Funds increases or decreases, then all other interest rates will do the same.
